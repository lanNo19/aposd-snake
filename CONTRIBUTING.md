## Creating the development environment

Check out the repository.

Create a virtual environment and activate it.

Install the dependencies and the project into the virtual environment:

```bash
pip3 install --editable .
```

To run the game, either call:

```
aposd-snake
```

... from your virtual environment or start `snake/main.py`.
